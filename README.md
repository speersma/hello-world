# hello-world
This is a test repository. Just figuring stuff out.

## Update1
Now I'm just testing out branching off a repository.

let's see if I can get a link in here about a [centerstat machine learning course](https://centerstat.org/machine-learning-theory-and-applications/). 

Awesome. It seems to have worked. It's *useful* that I'm already familiar with **markdown**.

Can I make tables in here? 

Title | Words | Moar Words | Less Woards
----- | ----- | ------ | -----
a great title | okay words | better words | less better words
